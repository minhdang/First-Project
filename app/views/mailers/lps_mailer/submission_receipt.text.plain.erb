Monitoring Your Progress: 
 
Updates will be displayed in real-time on your Live Product Search 
dashboard, which can be accessed on this page: 
http://www.edisonnation.com/dashboard/live_product_search 
Note: You may be prompted to log in. 
 
A green check mark on your dashboard means you have advanced to the 
next stage, a red X means that your idea was not selected. You may 
"opt out" of the Live Product Search up until you receive a green 
check mark in stage 7, by clicking the "opt out" button next to your 
submission. When you "opt out," you terminate your contract with 
Edison Nation and you are released and free to develop the product on 
your own. If you receive a green check mark on stage 7, we will be 
presenting the idea to the search partner, and if it is selected, you 
assign all rights to Edison Nation (Click here for compensation 
details outlined in the Innovator Agreement).

Feedback: 
 
Unfortunately, we can not offer one-on-one feedback for participants. Keep in mind that Edison Nation aims to satisfy the innovation needs of our search partners, as clearly defined in their Live Product Search descriptions. As a result, if your idea is not selected by the search partner it does not necessarily mean that it is not a good concept worth pursuing. It may simply means it was not the best fit for their current product innovation needs. 
 
Timeline: 
 
The time it takes to review your idea depends on the search specifics and the volume of submissions. We typically begin reviewing stages 4 and beyond after the search has closed. The review process after the search closes typically takes 4-6 weeks. After which, we present the finalists to our Live Product Search partner, who typically has 45 days from the presentation date to make their final selections.
